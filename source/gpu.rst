Basicly CPU is SISD (Single Instruction Single Data) Architecture in each core.
The multimedia instructions in CPU are smaller scaled of SIMD (Single 
Instruction Multiple Data) while GPU is a large scaled of SIMD processor, 
coloring millions of pixels of image in few mini seconds.
Since the 2D or 3D graphic processing provides large opportunity in parallel
data processing, GPU hardware usually composed of thousands
of functional units in each core in N-Vidia processors.

This chapter is giving a overview for how 3D animation to be created and run on
CPU+GPU. Give a concept for GPU compiler and HW featrues for graphic application.
Furthermore, explaining how GPU has taking more applications from 
CPU through GPGPU concept and related standards emerged.

3D modeling
------------

Through creating 3D model with Triangles or Quads along on skin, the 3D model
is created with polygon mesh [#polygon]_ formed by all the vertices on the first image 
as :numref:`modeling1`.

  Creating 3D model and texturing

After the next smooth shading [#polygon]_, the vertices and edge lines are covered 
with color (or remove edges, actually edge never has black line), and model looks 
much more smooth [#shading]_. 
Further, after texturing (texture mapping), the model looks real more 
[#texturemapping]_.
 
To get to know how animation for a 3D modeling, please look video here [#animation1]_.
According the video for skeleton animation, setting the joints poistion at different 
poses and giving time to each pose (keyframe) as :numref:`animation`.

  Set time point at keyframes


In this series of video, you find the 3D modeling tools creating Java instead of
C/C++ code calling OpenGL api and shaders. It's because Java can call OpenGL api
through a wrapper library [#joglwiki]_.

Every CAD software manufacturer such as AutoDesk and Blender has their own proprietary 
format. To solve the problem of interoperability, neutral or open source formats were 
invented as intermediate formats for converting between two proprietary formats. 
Naturally, these formats have become hugely popular now.
Two famous examples of neutral formats are STL (with a .STL extension) and COLLADA 
(with a .DAE extension). Here is the list, where the 3D file formats are marked 
with their type.

.. table:: 3D file formats [#3dfmt]_

  ==============  ==================
  3D file format  Type
  ==============  ==================
  STL             Neutral
  OBJ             ASCII variant is neutral, binary variant is proprietary
  FBX             Proprietary
  COLLADA         Neutral
  3DS             Proprietary
  IGES            Neutral
  STEP            Neutral
  VRML/X3D        Neutral
  ==============  ==================

The four key features a 3D file can store include the model’s geometry, the 
model’s surface texture, scene details, and animation of the model [#3dfmt]_.

Specifically, they can store details about four key features of a 3D model, 
though it’s worth bearing in mind that you may not always take advantage of 
all four features in all projects, and not all file formats support all four 
features!

3D printer applications do not to support animation. CAD and CAM such as
designing airplane does not need feature of scene details.

DAE (Collada) appeared in the video animation above.
Collada files  belong to a neutral format used heavily in the video game and 
film industries. It’s managed by the non-profit technology consortium, the 
Khronos Group.

The file extension for the Collada format is .dae.
The Collada format stores data using the XML mark-up language.

The original intention behind the Collada format was to become a standard among 
3D file formats. Indeed, in 2013, it was adopted by ISO as a publicly available 
specification, ISO/PAS 17506. As a result, many 3D modeling programs support 
the Collada format.

That said, the consensus is that the Collada format hasn’t kept up with the 
times. It was once used heavily as an interchange format for Autodesk Max/Maya 
in film production, but the industry has now shifted more towards OBJ, FBX, 
and Alembic [#3dfmt]_.


Graphic SW stack
----------------

The role of CPU and GPU for graphic animation as :numref:`graphic_cpu_gpu`.

.. _graphic_cpu_gpu: 
.. figure:: ../Fig/gpu/graphic-cpu-gpu.png
  :align: center
  :scale: 50 %

  OpenGL and Vulkan are both rendering APIs. In both cases, the GPU executes 
  shaders, while the CPU executes everything else [#ogl-cpu-gpu]_.

- GPU can't directly read user input from, say, keyboard, mouse, gamepad, or 
  play audio, or load files from a hard drive, or anything like that. In this
  situation, cannot let GPU handle the animation work [#cpu-gpu-role]_. 

The driver run on CPU side as :numref:`graphic_sw_stack`. 
The OpenGL Api will call
driver's function eventually and driver finish the function's work via issuing
GPU-HW's command and/or sending data to GPU. GPU's firmware only manage clock,
voltage, power comsumption, ..., etc [#gpu-firmware-jobs]_.
Even so, GPU's rendor work from the data of 3D vertex, colors, ... sending from 
CPU and storing in GPU's memory or shared memory consume more computing power
than CPU.

.. _graphic_sw_stack: 
.. graphviz:: ../Fig/gpu/graphic-sw-stack.gv
  :caption: Graphic SW Stack

- According the previous section, after user create skeleton and skin for each
  model and set keyframes time through 3D modeling tool, the 3D modeling tool 
  can either generate Java code which calling JOGL (Java OpenGL) [#joglwiki]_, 
  or generate OpenCL API directly. The frame data can be calculated from 
  interplation between keyframes.

- As above, every animation the client CPU program set new position of obect 
  (vertices) and colors, the data of one frame, server (driver and GPU) does 
  the 3D to 2D rendering. Higher-level
  libraries and frameworks on top of OpenGL provide animation framework and 
  tools to generate OpenGL API and shaders from 3D model. 

- Shader may call Builtin-functions which written from Compute Shader, spriv or 
  LLVM-IR. LLVM libclc is a project for builtin-functions in OpenCL which can 
  be used in OpenGL too [#libclc]_. 
  Like CPU's builtin-functions, new GPU ISA/architecture has to implement their 
  builtin-functions or porting from open source such as libclc.

- 3D model (CPU) does the rendering animation to generate each frame between
  keyframes (poses) while GPU does the rendering pipeline from each frame to
  each pixel's value.

- These frames data existed in the form of VAO (Vertex Array Object) in OpenGL.
  It will be explaned in later `section OpenGL`_.

- In addition, OpenGL provides vertex buffer object (VBO) allowing 
  vertex array data to be stored in high-performance graphics memory on the 
  server side and promotes efficient data transfer [#vbo]_ [#classorvbo]_.

- Double Buffering and VSync

  While the display is reading from the frame buffer to display the current 
  frame, we might be updating its contents for the next frame (not necessarily 
  in raster-scan manner). This would result in the so-called tearing, in which 
  the screen shows parts of the old frame and parts of the new frame.
  This could be resolved by using so-called double buffering. Instead of using 
  a single frame buffer, modern GPU uses two of them: a front buffer and a back 
  buffer. The display reads from the front buffer, while we can write the next 
  frame to the back buffer. When we finish, we signal to GPU to swap the front 
  and back buffer (known as buffer swap or page flip).

  Double buffering alone does not solve the entire problem, as the buffer swap 
  might occur at an inappropriate time, for example, while the display is in 
  the middle of displaying the old frame. This is resolved via the so-called 
  vertical synchronization (or VSync) at the end of the raster-scan. 
  When we signal to the GPU to do a buffer swap, the GPU will wait till the next
  VSync to perform the actual swap, after the entire current frame is displayed.

  As above console.
  The most important point is: When the VSync buffer-swap is enabled, you cannot 
  refresh the display faster than the refresh rate of the display!!! 
  If GPU is capable of producing higher frame rates than the display's 
  refresh rate, then GPU can use fast rate without tearing.
  If GPU has same or less frame rates then display's and you application 
  refreshes at a fixed rate, the resultant refresh rate is 
  likely to be an integral factor of the display's refresh rate, i.e., 1/2, 1/3, 
  1/4, etc. Otherwise it will cause tearing [#cg_basictheory]_.

- NVIDIA G-SYNC and AMD FreeSync

  If your monitor and graphics card both in your customer computer support 
  NVIDIA G-SYNC, you’re in luck. With this technology, a special chip in the 
  display communicates with the graphics card. This lets the monitor vary the 
  refresh rate to match the frame rate of the NVIDIA GTX graphics card, up to 
  the maximum refresh rate of the display. This means that the frames are 
  displayed as soon as they are rendered by the GPU, eliminating screen tearing 
  and reducing stutter for when the frame rate is both higher and lower than 
  the refresh rate of the display. This makes it perfect for situations where 
  the frame rate varies, which happens a lot when gaming. 
  Today, you can even find G-SYNC technology in gaming laptops! [#g-sync]_

  Additive colors in light



This section instroduces the basic geometry math for computer graphics. Every 
computer graphics book has provided topics of transformation of object and 
position in space. Chapter 4 of Blue book: OpenGL SuperBible 7th Edition give
a short description (40 pages) and useful concept is a good material for 
knowing the concept. Given the following for Quaternion Product (Hamilton 
product) from Wiki [#wiki-quaternion]_ since the book miss this.

.. math::

  \mathbf ij = -ji = k, jk = -kj = i, ki = -ik = j.


The complete concept can be found in
Book: "Computer graphics principles and practice 3rd editon, authors: JOHN F, 
...". But it is 1 thousand of pages.
This book is very complete and may take much time to understand every detail.

Both Triangles or Quads are ploygon. So, objects can be formed with ploygon in
both 2D and 3D. About transfermation in 2D or 3D, almost every book of computer 
graphics has mentioned well already. This section introduces the most important 
concept and method for deciding Inner and Outer planes, then a point or object
can be checked for showing or hidding during 2D or 3D rendering.

Any area of polygon can be calculated by dividing into Triangles or Quads. And
any area of Triangle or Quad can be calculated by cross product in 3D.
The cross product in **3D** is defined by the formula and can be represented with 
matrix notation as proved here [#cross-product-wiki]_.

.. math::

  \mathbf a \mathsf x \mathbf b = \Vert a \Vert \Vert b \Vert sin(\Theta) n

.. math::

  \mathbf a \mathsf x \mathbf b = 
  \begin{vmatrix}
  \mathbf i & \mathbf j& \mathbf k\\ 
  a_1& a_2& a_3\\ 
  b_1& b_2& b_3 
  \end{vmatrix}

The cross product in **2D** is defined by the formula and can be represented with matrix
notation as proved here 
[#cross-product-2d-proof]_ [#cross-product-2d-proof2]_.

.. math::

  \mathbf a \mathsf x \mathbf b = \Vert a \Vert \Vert b \Vert sin(\Theta)

.. math::

  \mathbf a \mathsf x \mathbf b = 
  \begin{vmatrix}
  \mathbf i & \mathbf j& \mathbf k\\ 
  a_1& a_2& 0\\ 
  b_1& b_2& 0 
  \end{vmatrix} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
  a_1& a_2 \\
  b_1& b_2
  \end{bmatrix}

After above matrix form is proved, the Antisymmetric may be proved as follows,

.. math::

  a \mathsf x b = \mathsf x&
  \begin{bmatrix}
  a \\ 
  b 
  \end{bmatrix} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
  a_1& a_2 \\ 
  b_1& b_2 
  \end{bmatrix} =
  a_1b_2 - a_2b_1 = 

.. math::

  -b_1a_2 - (-b_2a_1) = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
  - b_1& - b_2 \\ 
  a_1& a_2 
  \end{bmatrix} =
  \mathsf x&
  \begin{bmatrix}
  -b \\ 
  a 
  \end{bmatrix} =
  -b \mathsf x a 

In 2D, any two points :math:`\text{ from } P_i \text{ to } P_{i+1}` can form a 
vector and decide inner side or outer side.
For example, as :numref:`inward-edge-normals`, :math:`\Theta` is the angle
from :math:`P_iP_{i+1}` to :math:`P_iP'_{i+1} = 180^\circ`. 
So, with right-hand rule, counter clockwise order, any 
:math:`P_iQ` between :math:`P_iP_{i+1}` to :math:`P_iP'_{i+1}`, the angle of 
:math:`P_iP_{i+1}` to :math:`P_iQ = \theta, 0^\circ < \theta < 180^\circ` 
then the inward direction be decided.

  Inward edge normals

.. _2d-vector-inward: 
.. figure:: ../Fig/gpu/2d-vector-inward.png

  Inward and outward in 2D for a vector.

Base on this observation, the rule for inward and outward to any vector as
:numref:`inward-edge-normals`. Face the same direction of a specific vector, 
the left side is inward and right side is outward as 
:numref:`2d-vector-inward`.

For each edge :math:`P_i - P_{i+1}`, the inward edge normal is the vector 
:math:`\mathsf x\; v_i`; the outward edge normal is :math:`\; -\; \mathsf x\; v_i`.
Where :math:`\; \mathsf x\; v_i` is coss-product(:math:`\mathsf v_i`) as 
:numref:`inward-edge-normals`.


Polygon can be created from vertices. 
Suppose that :math:`(P_0, P_1, ..., P_n)` is a polygon. The line segments 
:math:`P_0P_1, P_1P_2`, etc., are the edges of the polygon; the vectors 
:math:`v_0 = P_1 - P_0, v_1 = P_2 - P_1, ..., v_n = P_0 - P_n` are the edges 
of the polygon. Through counter clockwise, the left side is inward, then the
inward region of polygon can be decided.

For a convex polygon whose vertices are listed in counter clockwise order, the 
inward edge normals point toward the interior of the polygon, and the outward 
edge normals point toward the unbounded exterior of the polygon, 
corresponding to our ordinary intuition. But if the vertices of a polygon are 
given in clockwise order, the interior and exterior swap roles. 

This cross product has an important property: Going from v to ×v involves a 
rotation by 90◦ in the same direction as the rotation that takes the positive 
x-axis to the positive y-axis.

  Draw a polygon with vectices counter clockwise

As :numref:`in-polygon`, when drawing polygon with vectors(lines) counter 
clockwise, the ploygon will be created and the two sides of a vector(line) 
can be indentified [#cgpap]_. 
Further a point in polygon or out of polygon can be identified.
One simple way of finding whether the point is inside or outside a simple 
polygon is to test how many times a ray, starting from the point and going in 
any fixed direction, intersects the edges of the polygon. If the point is on 
the outside of the polygon the ray will intersect its edge an even number of 
times. If the point is on the inside of the polygon then it will intersect the 
edge an odd number of times [#wiki-point-in-polygon]_.

  Cross product definition in 3D


In the same way, through following the same direction counter clockwise to 
create 2D polygon one by one, then the 3D polygon will be created.
As :numref:`3d-cross-product` from wiki [#cross-product-wiki]_, the inward 
direction can be decided with a x b < 0 and outward is a x b > 0 in OpenGL.
Replace a, b with x, y as :numref:`ogl-pointing-outwards` axis z+ is the 
outer surface and z- is the inner surface [#ogl-point-outwards]_.

  3D polygon with directions on each plane

The :numref:`in-3d-polygon` is an example of 3D polygon created by 2D triangles.
The direction of plane (triangle) as the line perpendicular to the plane.

Cast a ray from the 3D point along X-axis and check how many intersections with 
outer object you find. Depending on the intersection number on each axis (even 
or odd) you can understand if your point is inside or outside 
[#point-in-3d-object]_.
Inside is odd and outside is even. As :numref:`in-3d-object`, points on the 
line going through the object satisfy this rule.

  };

From code above, we can see that OpenGL uses counter clockwise and pointing
outwards as default. However OpenGL provides glFrontFace(GL_CW) for clockwise 
[#ogl_frontface]_.

For group of objects, scene graph provides better animation and saving memory

OpenGL

The following example from openGL redbook and example code [#redbook]_

   :language: c++
   :linenos:

Init(): 

- Generate Vertex Array VAOs and bind VAOs[0].

- According counter clockwise rule in previous section, Triangle Primitives are
  defined in varaible vertices. After binding OpenGL 
  VBO Buffers[0] to vertices, vertices data will send to memory of 
  server(gpu).
  Think of the "active" buffer as just a global variable, and there are a bunch 
  of functions which use the active buffer instead of using a parameter. 
  These global state variables are the ugly side of OpenGL [#vao-vbo-binding]_
  and can be replaced with glVertexArrayVertexBuffer(), 
  glVertexArrayAttribFormat(), ..., then call glBindVertexArray(vao)
  before drawing in OpenGL 4.5 [#ogl-vavb]_ [#ogl-bluebook-p152]_.

- glVertexAttribPointer( vPosition, 2, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 0, BUFFER_OFFSET(0) ):
  During gpu rendering, each vertex position will be held in vPosition and pass
  to "triangles.vert" shader because LoadShaders( shaders ).

glfwSwapBuffers(window):

- You’ve already used double buffering for animation. Double buffering is done 
  by making the main color buffer have two parts: a front buffer that’s 
  displayed in your window; and a back buffer, which is where you render the 
  new image. When you swap the buffers (by calling glfwSwapBuffers(), for 
  example), the front and back buffers are exchanged [#redbook-colorbuffer]_.

display():

- Bind VAOs[0], set render mode to GL_TRIANGLES and send vertex data to Buffer
  (gpu memory, OpenGL pipeline). Next, GPU will do rendering pipeline descibed
  in next section.

The triangles.vert has input vPosition and no output variable, so using 
gl_Position default varaible without declaration. The triangles.frag has not 
defined input variable and has defined output variable fColor instead of using
gl_FragColor.

The "in" and "out" in shaders above are "type qualifier". 
A type qualifier is used in the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) to modify the 
storage or behavior of global and locally defined variables. These qualifiers 
change particular aspects of the variable, such as where they get their data 
from and so forth [#ogl-qualifier]_. 

Though attribute and varying are removed from later version 1.4 of OpenGL,
many materials in website using them [#ogl-qualifier-deprecate]_ 
[#github-attr-varying-depr]_. 
It's better to use "in" and "out" to replace
them as the following code.
OpenGL has a few ways to binding API's variable with shader's variable.
glVertexAttrib* as the following code and glBindAttribLocation() 
[#ogl-layout-q]_, ...

.. rubric:: replace attribute and varying with in and out
.. code-block:: c++

  uniform float scale;
  layout (location = 0) attribute vec2 position;
  // layout (location = 0) in vec2 position;
  layout (location = 1) attribute vec4 color;
  // layout (location = 1) in vec4 color;
  varying vec4 v_color;
  // out v_color

  void main()
  {
    gl_Position = vec4(position*scale, 0.0, 1.0);
    v_color = color;
  }

.. code-block:: c++

  // OpenGL API
  GLfloat attrib[] = { x * 0.5f, x * 0.6f, x* 0.4f, 0.0f };
  // Update the value of input attribute 1 : layout (location = 1) in vec4 color
  glVertexAttrib4fv(1, attrib);

.. code-block:: c++

  varying vec4 v_color;
  // in vec4 v_color;

  void main()
  {
    gl_FragColor = v_color;
  }

An OpenGL program is made of two shaders [#monstar-lab-opengl]_ 
[#glumpy-shaders]_:

- The vertex shader is (commonly) executed once for every vertex we want to 
  draw. It receives some attributes as input, computes the position of this 
  vertex in space and returns it in a variable called gl_Position. It also 
  defines some varyings.

- The fragment shader is executed once for each pixel to be rendered. It 
  receives some varyings as input, computes the color of this pixel and 
  returns it in a variable called fColor.

Since we have 6 vertices in our buffer, this shader will be executed 6 times by 
the GPU (once per vertex)! We can also expect all 6 instances of the shader to 
be executed in parallel, since a GPU have so many cores.

3D Rendering
------------

Based on the previous section of 3D modeling, the 3D modeling tool will generate
3D vertex model and OpenGL code, then programmers may hand-change OpenGL code and
add or modify shaders. The 3D animation will trigger the 3D rendering for each
2D image drawing.

3D rendering is the process of converting 3D models into 2D images on a computer 
[#3drendering_wiki]_.

  * - Stage.
    - Description
  * - Vertex Specification
    - After setting data as the example of previous section, glDrawArrays() will send data to gpu through buffer objects.
  * - Vertex Shading
    - **Vertex -> Vertex and other data such as color for later passes.** For each vertex that is issued by a drawing command, a vertex shader will be called to process the data associated with that vertex.
  * - Tessellation Shading
    - **Create more detail on demand when room in.** After the vertex shader has processed each vertex’s associated data, the tessellation shader stage will continue processing that data, if it’s been activated. Reference below.
  * - Geometry Shading
    - **The next shader stage, geometry shading, allows additional processing of individual geometric primitives, including creating new ones, before rasterization.** Chapter 10 of Red Book [#redbook]_ has details.
  * - Primitive Assembly
    - The previous shading stages all operate on vertices, with the information about how those vertices are organized into geometric primitives being carried along internal to OpenGL. **The primitive assembly stage organizes the vertices into their associated geometric primitives in preparation for clipping and rasterization.**
  * - Clipping
    - **Clipping hidden parts.** Occasionally, vertices will be outside of the viewport—the region of the window where you’re permitted to draw—and cause the primitive associated with that vertex to be modified so none of its pixels are outside of the viewport. This operation is called clipping and is handled automatically by OpenGL.
  * - Rasterization
    - **Vertex -> Fragment.** The job of the rasterizer is to determine which screen locations are covered by a particular piece of geometry (point, line, or triangle). Knowing those locations, along with the input vertex data, the rasterizer linearly interpolates the data values for each varying variable in the fragment shader and sends those values as inputs into your fragment shader.
  * - Fragment Shading
    - **Determine color for each pixel.** The final stage where you have programmable control over the color of a screen location is fragment shading. In this shader stage, you use a shader to determine the fragment’s final color (although the next stage, per-fragment operations, can modify the color one last time) and potentially its depth value. Fragment shaders are very powerful, as they often employ texture mapping to augment the colors provided by the vertex processing stages. A fragment shader may also terminate processing a fragment if it determines the fragment shouldn’t be drawn; this process is called fragment discard. A helpful way of thinking about the difference between shaders that deal with vertices and fragment shaders is this: vertex shading (including tessellation and geometry shading) determines where on the screen a primitive is, while fragment shading uses that information to determine what color that fragment will be.
  * - Per-Fragment Operations
    - During this stage, a fragment’s visibility is determined using depth testing (also commonly known as z-buffering) and stencil testing. If a fragment successfully makes it through all of the enabled tests, it may be written directly to the framebuffer, updating the color (and possibly depth value) of its pixel, or **if blending is enabled, the fragment’s color will be combined with the pixel’s current color to generate a new color that is written into the framebuffer.**


- Tessellation Shading: 
  The core problem that Tessellation deals with is the static nature of 3D models
  in terms of their detail and polygon count. The thing is that when we look at 
  a complex model such as a human face up close we prefer to use a highly 
  detailed model that will bring out the tiny details (e.g. skin bumps, etc). 
  A highly detailed model automatically translates to more triangles and more 
  compute power required for processing. ... 
  One possible way to solve this problem using the existing features of OpenGL 
  is to generate the same model at multiple levels of detail (LOD). For example, 
  highly detailed, average and low. We can then select the version to use based 
  on the distance from the camera. This, however, will require more artist 
  resources and often will not be flexible enough. ...
  Let's take a look at how Tessellation has been implemented in the graphics 
  pipeline. The core components that are responsible for Tessellation are two 
  new shader stages and in between them a fixed function stage that can be 
  configured to some degree but does not run a shader. The first shader stage 
  is called Tessellation Control Shader (TCS), the fixed function stage is 
  called the Primitive Generator (PG), and the second shader stage is called 
  Tessellation Evaluation Shader (TES). 
  Some GPU havn't this fixed function stage implemented in HW and even havn't
  provide these TCS, TES and Gemoetry Shader. User can write Compute Shaders 
  instead for this on-fly detail display.
  This surface is usually defined by some polynomial formula and the idea is 
  that moving a CP has an effect on the entire surface. ...
  The group of CPs is usually called a Patch [#ts-tu30]_.
  Chapter 9 of Red Book [#redbook]_ has details.

For 2D animation, the model is created by 2D only (1 face only), so it only can be 
viewed from the same face of model. If you want to display different faces of model,
multiple 2D models need to be created and switch these 2D models from face(flame) to 
face(flame) from time to time [#2danimation]_.


GLSL (GL Shader Language)
-------------------------

OpenGL is a standard for designing 2D/3D animation in computer graphic.
To do animation well, OpenGL provides a lots of api(functions) call for
graphic processing. The 3D model construction tools such as Maya, Blender, ..., etc,
only need to call this api to finish the 3D to 2D projecting function in computer.
Any GPU hardware dependent code in these api provided by GPU manufacturer.
An OpenGL program looks like the following,

.. rubric:: Vertex shader
.. code-block:: c++

  #version 330 core
  layout (location = 0) in vec3 aPos; // the position variable has attribute position 0
    
  out vec4 vertexColor; // specify a color output to the fragment shader
  
  void main()
  {
      gl_Position = vec4(aPos, 1.0); // see how we directly give a vec3 to vec4's constructor
      vertexColor = vec4(0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0); // set the output variable to a dark-red color
  }

.. rubric:: Fragment shader
.. code-block:: c++

  #version 330 core
  out vec4 FragColor;
    
  in vec4 vertexColor; // the input variable from the vertex shader (same name and same type)  
  
  void main()
  {
      FragColor = computeColorOfThisPixel(...);
  } 
  
.. rubric:: OpenGl user program
.. code-block:: c++

  int main(int argc, char ** argv)
  {
    // init window, detect user input and do corresponding animation by calling opengl api
    ...
  }

The last main() is programed by user obviously. Let's explain what the first two 
main() work for. 
As you know, the OpenGL is a lots of api to let programmer display the 3D object 
into 2D computer screen explained from book of concept of computer graphic.
3D graphic model can set light and object texture by user firstly, and calculating the 
postion of each vertex secondly, then color for each pixel automatically by 3D software 
and GPU thirdly, finally display the color of each pixel in computer screen.
But in order to let user/programmer add some special effect or decoration in 
coordinate for each vertex or in color for each pixel, OpenGL provides these two 
functions to do it. 
OpenGL uses fragment shader instead of pixel is : "Fragment shaders are a more 
accurate name for the same functionality as Pixel shaders. They aren’t pixels 
yet, since the output still has to past several tests (depth, alpha, stencil) 
as well as the fact that one may be using antialiasing, which renders 
one-fragment-to-one-pixel non-true [#fragmentshader_reason]_.
Programmer is allowed to add their converting functions that compiler translate them 
into GPU instructions running on GPU processor. With these two shaders, new 
features have been added to allow for increased flexibility in the rendering 
pipeline at the vertex and fragment level [#shaderswiki]_.
Unlike the shaders example here [#shadersex]_, some converting functions 
for coordinate in vertex shader or for color in fragment shade are more 
complicated according the scenes of 
animation. Here is an example [#glsleffect]_.
In wiki shading page [#shading]_, Gourand and Phong shading methods make the
surface of object more smooth by glsl. Example glsl code of Gourand 
and Phong shading on OpenGL api are here [#smoothshadingex]_.
Since the hardware of graphic card and software graphic driver can be replaced, 
the compiler is run on-line meaning driver will compile the shaders program when 
it is run at first time and kept in cache after compilation [#on-line]_.

The shaders program is C-like syntax and can be compiled in few mini-seconds, 
add up this few mini-seconds of on-line compilation time in running OpenGL 
program is a good choice for dealing the cases of driver software or gpu 
hardware replacement [#onlinecompile]_. 


OpenGL Shader compiler
-----------------------

OpenGL standard is here [#openglspec]_. The OpenGL is for desktop computer or server
while the OpenGL ES is for embedded system [#opengleswiki]_. Though shaders are only
a small part of the whole OpenGL software/hardware system. It is still a large effort 
to finish the compiler implementation since there are lots of api need to be 
implemented.
For example, there are 80 related texture APIs [#textureapi]_.
This implementation can be done by generating llvm extended intrinsic functions 
from shader parser of frontend compiler as well as llvm backend converting those intrinsic 
to gpu instructions as follows,

.. rubric:: Fragment shader
.. code-block:: c++

  #version 320 es
  uniform sampler2D x;
  out vec4 FragColor;
  
  void main()
  {
      FragColor = texture(x, uv_2d, bias);
  }
  
.. rubric:: llvm-ir
.. code-block:: text

  ...
  !1 = !{!"sampler_2d"}
  !2 = !{i32 SAMPLER_2D} ; SAMPLER_2D is integer value for sampler2D, for example: 0x0f02
  ; A named metadata.
  !x_meta = !{!1, !2}

  define void @main() #0 {
      ...
      %1 = @llvm.gpu0.texture(metadata !x_meta, %1, %2, %3); ; %1: %sampler_2d, %2: %uv_2d, %3: %bias
      ...
  }
  
.. rubric:: asm of gpu
.. code-block:: asm

  ...
  // gpu machine code
  load $1, tex_a;
  sample2d_inst $1, $2, $3 // $1: tex_a, $2: %uv_2d, $3: %bias

  .tex_a // Driver set the index of gpu descriptor regsters here

As the bottom of code above, .tex_a memory address includes the Texture Object
which binding by driver in on-line compilation/linking. Through binding Texture
Object (SW) and Texture Unit (HW) with OpenGL API, gpu will uses Texture Unit HW
resources efficiently. Explaining it the following. 
      
About llvm intrinsic extended function, please refer this book here [#intrinsiccpu0]_.

.. code-block:: c++

  gvec4 texture(gsampler2D sampler, vec2 P, [float bias]);


GPU provides 'Texture Unit' to speedup fragment shader. However the 
‘Texture Unit’ HW is expensive resouce and only few of them in a GPU. 
Driver can associate ‘Texture Unit’ to sampler variable by OpenGL api 
and switch between shaders as the following statements.

.. _sampling: 
.. figure:: ../Fig/gpu/sampling_diagram.png
  :align: center
  :scale: 60 %

  Relationships between the texturing concept [#textureobject]_.

The :numref:`sampling` as above.
The texture object is not bound directly into the shader (where the actual 
sampling takes place). Instead, it is bound to a 'texture unit' whose index 
is passed to the shader. So the shader reaches the texture object by going 
through the texture unit. There are usually multiple texture units available 
and the exact number depends on the capability of your graphic card [#textureobject]_. 
A texture unit, also called a texture mapping unit (TMU) or a texture processing 
unit (TPU), is a hardware component in a GPU that does sampling operation.
The argument sampler in texture function as above is sampler_2d index from
'teuxture unit' for texture object [#textureobject]_. 

'sampler uniform variable':

There is a group of special uniform variables for that, according to the texture 
target: 'sampler1D', 'sampler2D', 'sampler3D', 'samplerCube', etc. 
You can create as many 'sampler uniform variables' as you want and assign the 
value of a texture unit to each one from the application. 
Whenever you call a sampling function on a 'sampler uniform variable' the 
corresponding texture unit (and texture object) will be used [#textureobject]_.


.. _sampling_binding: 
.. figure:: ../Fig/gpu/sampling_diagram_binding.png
  :align: center

  Binding sampler variables [#tpu]_.

As :numref:`sampling_binding`, the Java api
gl.bindTexture binding 'Texture Object' to 'Texture Unit'. 
The gl.getUniformLocation and gl.uniform1i associate 'Texture Unit' to
'sampler uniform variables'. 

gl.uniform1i(xLoc, 1): where 1 is 
'Texture Unit 1', 2 is 'Texture Unit 2', ..., etc [#tpu]_.

The following figure depicts how driver read metadata from compiled glsl obj,
OpenGL api associate 'Sample Variable' and gpu executing texture instruction.

.. _driverSamplerTable: 
.. figure:: ../Fig/gpu/driverSamplerTable.png
  :align: center

  Associating Sampler Variables and gpu executing texture instruction

Explaining the detail steps for figure above as the following.

1. In order to let the 'texture unit' binding by driver, frontend compiler must
pass the metadata of 'sampler uniform variable' (sampler_2d_var in this example) 
[#samplervar]_ to backend, and backend must 
allocate the metadata of 'sampler uniform variable' in the compiled 
binary file [#metadata]_. 

2. After gpu driver executing glsl on-line compiling,
driver read this metadata from compiled binary file and maintain a 
table of {name, type, location} for each 'sampler uniform variable'.
Driver also fill this information to Texture Desciptor in GPU's memory.

3. Api,

.. code-block:: c++

  xLoc = gl.getUniformLocation(prog, "x"); // prog: glsl program, xLoc
  
will get the location from the table for 'sampler uniform variable' x that
driver created.

SAMPLER_2D: is integer value for Sampler2D type.


4. Api,

.. code-block:: c++

  gl.uniform1i( xLoc, 1 );
  
will binding xLoc of 'sampler uniform variable' x to 
'Texture Unit 1' by writing 1 to the glsl binary metadata location of
'sampler uniform variable' x as follows,

.. code-block:: console

  {xLoc, 1} : 1 is 'Texture Unit 1', xLoc is the location(memory address) of 'sampler uniform variable' x
  
This api will set the texture descriptors in gpu with this {xLoc, 1} 
information.
Next, driver set the index or memory address of gpu texture descriptors to 
variable .tex_a of memory address. For example as diagram, driver set k to 
.tex_a.
  
5.

.. code-block:: console

  // gpu machine code
  load $1, tex_a;
  sample2d_inst $1, $2, $3 // $1: tex_a, $2: %uv_2d, $3: %bias

  .tex_a // Driver set the index of gpu descriptor regsters here at step 4
      
When executing the texture instructions from glsl binary file on gpu, the 
corresponding 'Texture Unit 1' on gpu will being executed through texture 
descriptor in gpu's memory because .tex_a: {xLoc, 1}. Driver may set
texture descriptor in gpu's texture desciptors if gpu provides specific
texture descriptors in architecture [#descriptorreg]_.

For instance, Nvidia texture instruction as follow,

.. code-block:: console

  // the content of tex_a bound to texture unit as step 5 above
  tex.3d.v4.s32.s32  {r1,r2,r3,r4}, [tex_a, {f1,f2,f3,f4}];

  .tex_a

The content of tex_a bound to texture unit set by driver as the end of step 4.
The pixel of coordinates (x,y,z) is given by (f1,f2,f3) user input.
The f4 is skipped for 3D texture.

Above tex.3d texture instruction load the calculated color of pixel (x,y,z) from 
texture image into GPRs (r1,r2,r3,r4)=(R,G,B,A). 
And fragment shader can re-calculate the color of this pixel with the color of
this pixel at texture image [#ptxtex]_. 

If it is 1d texture instruction, the tex.1d as follows,

.. code-block:: console

  tex.1d.v4.s32.f32  {r1,r2,r3,r4}, [tex_a, {f1}];

Since 'Texture Unit' is limited hardware accelerator on gpu, OpenGL
providing api to user program for binding 'Texture Unit' to 'Sampler Variables'.
As a result, user program is allowed doing load balance in using 'Texture Unit'
through OpenGL api without recompiling glsl. 
Fast texture sampling is one of the key requirements for good GPU performance 
[#tpu]_.

In addition to api for binding texture, OpenGL provides glTexParameteri api to
do Texture Wrapping [#texturewrapper]_. 
Furthmore the texture instruction for some gpu may including S# T# values in operands.
Same with associating 'Sampler Variables' to 'Texture Unit', S# and T# are
location of memory associated to Texture Wrapping descriptor registers allowing 
user program to change Wrapping option without re-compiling glsl.

Even glsl frontend compiler always expanding function call into inline function 
as well as llvm intrinsic extended function providing an easy way to do code 
generation through llvm td (Target Description) file written, 
GPU backend compiler is still a little complex than CPU backend. 
(But when considering the effort in frontend compier such as clang, or other 
toolchain such
as linker and gdb/lldb, of course, CPU compiler is not easier than
GPU compiler.)

Here is the software stack of 3D graphic system for OpenGL in linux [#mesawiki]_.
And mesa open source website is here [#mesa]_.

Architecture
------------

SIMT
~~~~

Single instruction, multiple threads (SIMT) is an execution model used in 
parallel computing where single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) is combined 
with multithreading [#simt-wiki]_.

The leading GPU architecture of Nvidia's gpu is as the following 
figures.

Buffers
~~~~~~~

In addition the texture unit and instruction, GPU provides different Buffers
to speedup OpenGL pipeline rendering [#buffers-redbook]_.

- Color buffer

  They contain the RGB or sRGB color data and may also contain alpha values for 
  each pixel in the framebuffer. There may be multiple color buffers in a 
  framebuffer.
  You’ve already used double buffering for animation. Double buffering is done 
  by making the main color buffer have two parts: a front buffer that’s displayed 
  in your window; and a back buffer, which is where you render the new image 
  [#redbook-p155]_.

- Depth buffer (Z buffer)

  Depth is measured in terms of distance to the eye, so pixels with larger 
  depth-buffer values are overwritten by pixels with smaller values 
  [#redbook-p156]_ [#z-buffer-wiki]_ [#depthstencils-ogl]_.

- Stencil Buffer

  In the simplest case, the stencil buffer is used to limit the area of 
  rendering (stenciling) [#stencils-buffer-wiki]_ [#depthstencils-ogl]_.  

- Frame Buffer

  OpenGL offers: the color, depth and stencil buffers. 
  This combination of buffers is known as the default framebuffer and as you've 
  seen, a framebuffer is an area in memory that can be rendered to 
  [#framebuffers-ogl]_. 

General purpose GPU
--------------------

Since GLSL shaders provide a general way for writing C code in them, if applying
a software frame work instead of OpenGL api, then the system can run some data
parallel computation on GPU for speeding up and even get CPU and GPU executing 
simultaneously. Furthmore, any language that allows the code running on the CPU to poll 
a GPU shader for return values, can create a GPGPU framework [#gpgpuwiki]_.

    - Cuda Thread Engine
    - Each Grid has 16 SIMD Processors.
    - Each multithreaded SIMD Processor is assigned 512 elements of the vectors to

      SIMD Processors are full processors with separate PCs and are programmed using

      CPU Core is the processor which include multi-threads. A thread of CPU is 
      execution unit with its own PC (Program Counter). As this concept, GPU
      Core is the SIMD Processor includes several SIMD Thread (Warp). Each Warp

    - Each Warp has 16 Cuda Thread. 
    - Warp has it's own PC and TLR (Thread Level Registers). Warp may map to
      one whole function or part of function. Compiler and run time may assign
      them to the same Warp or different Warps [#Quantitative-gpu-warp]_.
  * - SIMD Lane
    - Cuda Thread
    - Each SIMD Thread has 16 Lanes.
    - A vertical cut of a thread of SIMD instructions corresponding to 
      one element executed by one SIMD Lane. It is a vector instruction with processing 16-elements.
  * - Chime
    - Chime
    - Each SIMD Lane has 2 chimes.
    - If vector length would be 32 (32 elements) and SIMD Lanes is 16, the 
      chime is 2 clock cycles, also known as “ping pong” cycles.
      As :numref:`grid` for the later Fermi-generation GPUs.
      Each SIMD Thread (Warp) has 32 elements run as :numref:`threadslanes` on 16 SIMD 
      lanes (number of functional units just same as in vector processor). 
      So it takes 2 clock cycles to (chime is 2 clock cycles) complete [#lanes]_.

- If a SIMD Lane (Cuda Thread) handles 2 elements computing, assuming 4 
  registers for 1 element, then there are 4*32=128 Thread Level Registers, TLR, 
  occupied in a SIMD Thread (Warp) to support the SIMT computing. 
  So, assume a GPU architecture allocating 256 TLR to a SIMD Thread (Warp), then 
  it has sufficient TLR for more complicated statement, such as 
  a*X[i]+b*Y[i]+c*Z[i] without spilling in register allocation. All 16 lanes 
  share the 256 TLR. 
  Each Thread Block (Core/Warp) has 16 SIMD Threads, so there are 16*256 = 4K 
  TLR in a SIMD Processor (Core, Cuda Thread Engine).

- When mapping to the fragments/pixels in graphic GPU, x[0..15] corresponding to
  a two dimensions of tile of fragments/pixels at pixel[0..3][0..3] since image
  uses tile base for grouping closest color together.

The following is a CUDA example to run large data in array on GPU [#cudaex]_ 
as follows,

.. code-block:: c++

The main() run on CPU while the saxpy() run on GPU. Through 
cudaMemcpyHostToDevice and cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost, CPU can pass data in x and y
arrays to GPU and get result from GPU to y array. 
Since both of these memory transfers trigger the DMA functions without CPU operation,
it may speed up by running both CPU/GPU with their data in their own cache 
repectively.
After DMA memcpy from cpu's memory to gpu's, gpu operates the whole loop of matrix 
operation for "y[] = a*x[]+y[];"
instructions with one Grid. Furthermore like vector processor, gpu provides
Vector Mask Registers to Handling IF Statements in Vector Loops as the following 
code [#VMR]_,

.. code:: text

  for(i=0;i<64; i=i+1)
    if (X[i] != 0)
      X[i] = X[i] – Y[i];


.. code:: asm

  LV V1,Rx         ;load vector X into V1
  LV V2,Ry         ;load vector Y
  L.D F0,#0        ;load FP zero into F0
  SNEVS.D V1,F0    ;sets VM(i) to 1 if V1(i)!=F0
  SUBVV.D V1,V1,V2 ;subtract under vector mask 
  SV V1,Rx         ;store the result in X


GPU persues throughput from SIMD application. Can hide cache-miss latence from 
SMT. As result GPU may hasn't L2 and L3 like CPU for each core since GPU is highly 
latency-tolerant multithreading for data parallel application [#gpu-latency-tolerant]_.
DMA memcpy map the data in cpu memory to each l1 cache of core on gpu memory.
Many gpu provides operations scatter and gather to access DRAM data for stream 
processing [#Quantitative-gpu-sparse-matrix]_ [#gpgpuwiki]_ [#shadingl1]_.

When the GPU function is dense computation in array such as MPEG4 encoder or
deep learning for tuning weights, it may get much speed up [#mpeg4speedup]_. 
However when GPU function is matrix addition and CPU will idle for waiting 
GPU's result. It may slow down than doing matrix addition by CPU only.
Arithmetic intensity is defined as the number of operations performed per word of 
memory transferred. It is important for GPGPU applications to have high arithmetic 
intensity else the memory access latency will limit computational speedup 
[#gpgpuwiki]_. 

Wiki here [#gpuspeedup]_ includes speedup applications for gpu as follows:

General Purpose Computing on GPU, has found its way into fields as diverse as 
machine learning, oil exploration, scientific image processing, linear algebra,
statistics, 3D reconstruction and even stock options pricing determination.
In addition, section "GPU accelerated video decoding and encoding" for video 
compressing [#gpuspeedup]_ gives the more applications for GPU acceleration.


.. table:: The differences for speedup in architecture of CPU and GPU

  ============  ================================  =========
  Item          CPU                               GPU

  ============  ================================  =========
                             
.. note:: **GPU-Cache**
 
  In theory for data parallel application in GPU's SMT, GPU can schedule more
  threads and pursues throughput rather speedup for one single thread as SISD in
  CPU. However in reality, GPU provides small L1 cache like CPU's and fill the 
  cache-miss with scheduline another thread. So, GPU may has no L2 and L3 while
  CPU has deep level of caches.


Vulkan and spir-v
-----------------

.. _opencl_to_spirv: 
.. figure:: ../Fig/gpu/opencl-to-spirv-offine-compilation.png
  :align: center
  :scale: 40 %

  Offline Compilation of OpenCL Kernels into SPIR-V Using Open Source Tooling [#opencl-to-spirv]_

.. _glsl_spirv: 
.. graphviz:: ../Fig/gpu/glsl-spirv.gv
  :caption: Convertion between glsl and spirv

- Comparsion for OpenCL and OpenGL's compute shader.

  - Same:

    Both are for General Computing of GPU.

  - Difference:

    OpenCL include GPU and other accelerate device/processor.
    OpenCL is C language on Device and C++ on Host based on OpenCL runtime. 
    Compute shader is GLSL shader language run on OpenGL graphic enviroment and
    integrate and access data of OpenGL API easily [#diff-compute-shader-opencl]_.

- OpenGL/GLSL vs Vulkan/spir-v.

  - High level of API and shader: OpenGL, GLSL.

  - Low level of API and shader: Vulkan, spir-v.

Though OpenGL api existed in higher level with many advantages from sections
above, sometimes it cannot compete in efficience with direct3D providing 
lower levels api for operating memory by user program [#vulkanapiwiki]_. 
Vulkan api is lower level's C/C++ api to fill the gap allowing user program to 
do these things in OpenGL to compete against Microsoft direct3D. 
Here is an example [#vulkanex]_. Meanwhile glsl is C-like language. The vulkan 
infrastructure provides tool, glslangValidator [#spirvtoolchain]_, to compile 
glsl into an Intermediate Representation 
Form (IR) called spir-v off-line. 
As a result, it saves part of compilation time from glsl to gpu instructions 
on-line
since spir-v is an IR of level closing to llvm IR [#spirvwiki]_. 
In addition, vulkan api reduces gpu drivers efforts in optimization and code 
generation [#vulkanapiwiki]_. These standards provide user programmer option to 
using vulkan/spir-v instead of OpenGL/glsl, and allow them pre-compiling glsl 
into spir-v off-line to saving part of on-line compilation time.

With vulkan and spir-v standard, the gpu can be used in OpenCL for Parallel 
Programming of Heterogeneous Systems [#opencl]_ [#computekernelwiki]_.
Similar with Cuda, a OpenCL example for fast Fourier transform (FFT) is here 
[#openclexfft]_.
Once OpenCL grows into a popular standard when more computer languages or 
framework supporting OpenCL language, GPU will take more jobs from CPU 
[#opencl-wiki-supported-lang]_.

Now, you find llvm IR expanding from cpu to gpu becoming influentially more and
more. And actually, llvm IR expanding from version 3.1 util now as I can feel.


Accelerate ML/DL on OpenCL/SYCL
-------------------------------

.. _opengl_ml_graph: 
.. figure:: ../Fig/gpu/opencl_ml_graph.png
  :align: center
  :scale: 50 %

  Implement ML graph scheduler both on compiler and runtime


As above figure, the Device of GPU or CPU+NPU is able to run the whole ML graph. 
However if the Device has NPU only, then the CPU operation such as Avg-Pool
has to run on Host side which add communication cost between Host and Device.

Like OpenGL's shader, the "kernel" function may be compiled on-line or off-line
and sending to GPU as programmable functions.
 
In order to run ML (Machine Learning) efficiently, all platforms for ML on 
GPU/NPU implement scheduling SW both on graph compiler and runtime. 
**If OpenCL can extend to support ML graph, then graph compiler such as TVM or 
Runtime from Open Source have chance to leverage the effort of scheduling SW from 
programmers** [#paper-graph-on-opencl]_. Cuda graph is an idea  like this 
[#cuda-graph-blog]_ [#cuda-graph-pytorch]_ .

It is identical to a hardware thread scheduler in a traditional multithreaded processor (see Chapter 3), just that it is scheduling threads of SIMD instructions. Thus, GPU hardware has two levels of hardware schedulers: (1) the Thread Block Scheduler that assigns Thread Blocks (bodies of vectorized loops) to multi- threaded SIMD Processors, which ensures that thread blocks are assigned to the processors whose local memories have the corresponding data, and (2) the SIMD Thread Scheduler within a SIMD Processor, which schedules when threads of SIMD instructions should run.
