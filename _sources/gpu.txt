=======================================

   :depth: 4

Basicly CPU compiler is SISD (Single Instruction Single Data Architecture). 
The multimedia instructions in CPU are small scaled of SIMD
(Single Instruction Multiple Data) for 4 or 16 elements while GPU is a large 
scaled of SIMD processor coloring millions of pixels of image in few 
micro seconds.
Since the 2D or 3D graphic processing provides large opportunity in parallel
data processing, GPU hardware usually composed of thousands
of functional units in each core(grid) in N-Vidia processors.

The flow for 3D/2D graphic processing as the following diagram.

  OpenGL flow

The most of time for running OpenGL api is on GPU. Usually, CPU is a function 
call to GPU's functions.
This chapter is giving a concept for the flow above and focuses on shader compiler
for GPU. Furthermore, explaining how GPU has taking more applications from 
CPU through GPGPU concept and related standards emerged.


3D modeling
------------

Through creating 3D model with Triangles or Quads along on skin, the 3D model
is created with polygon mesh [#polygon]_ formed by all the vertices on the first image 
as follows,

.. _modeling1:

  :align: center
  :scale: 80 %

  Creating 3D model and texturing

After the next smooth shading [#polygon]_, the vertices and edge lines are covered 
with color (or remove edges), and model looks much more smooth [#shading]_. 
Further, after texturing (texture mapping), the model looks real more 
[#texturemapping]_.
 
To get to know how animation for a 3D modeling, please look video here [#animation1]_.
In this series of video, you find the 3D modeling tools creating Java instead of
C/C++ code calling OpenGL api and shaders. It's because Java can call OpenGL api
through a wrapper library [#joglwiki]_.

Every CAD software manufacturer such as AutoDesk and Blender has their own proprietary 
format. To solve the problem of interoperability, neutral or open source formats were 
invented as intermediate formats for converting between two proprietary formats. 
Naturally, these formats have become hugely popular now.
Two famous examples of neutral formats are STL (with a .STL extension) and COLLADA 
(with a .DAE extension). Here is the list, where the 3D file formats are marked 
with their type.

.. table:: 3D file formats [#3dfmt]_

  ==============  ==================
  3D file format  Type
  ==============  ==================
  STL             Neutral
  OBJ             ASCII variant is neutral, binary variant is proprietary
  FBX             Proprietary
  COLLADA         Neutral
  3DS             Proprietary
  IGES            Neutral
  STEP            Neutral
  VRML/X3D        Neutral
  ==============  ==================


3D Rendering
------------

3D rendering is the process of converting 3D models into 2D images on a computer 
[#3drendering_wiki]_. The steps as the following Figure [#rendering]_.

.. _rendering_pipeline1: 
.. figure:: ../Fig/gpu/rendering_pipeline.png
  :align: center
  :scale: 80 %

  Diagram of the Rendering Pipeline. The blue boxes are programmable shader stages.


For 2D animation, the model is created by 2D only (1 face only), so it only can be 
viewed from the same face of model. If you want to display different faces of model,
multiple 2D models need to be created and switch these 2D models from face(flame) to 
face(flame) from time to time [#2danimation]_.

GLSL (GL Shader Language)
-------------------------

OpenGL is a standard for designing 2D/3D animation in computer graphic.
To do animation well, OpenGL provides a lots of api(functions) call for
graphic processing. The 3D model construction tools such as Maya, Blender, ..., etc,
only need to call this api to finish the 3D to 2D projecting function in computer.
Any GPU hardware dependent code in these api provided by GPU manufacturer.
An OpenGL program looks like the following,

.. code-block:: c++

  Vertex shader
  
  #version 330 core
  layout (location = 0) in vec3 aPos; // the position variable has attribute position 0
    
  out vec4 vertexColor; // specify a color output to the fragment shader
  
  void main()
  {
      gl_Position = vec4(aPos, 1.0); // see how we directly give a vec3 to vec4's constructor
      vertexColor = vec4(0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0); // set the output variable to a dark-red color
  }
  Fragment shader
  
  #version 330 core
  out vec4 FragColor;
    
  in vec4 vertexColor; // the input variable from the vertex shader (same name and same type)  
  
  void main()
  {
      FragColor = computeColorOfThisPixel(...);
  } 
  
  // openGl user program
  int main(int argc, char ** argv)
  {
    // init window, detect user input and do corresponding animation by calling opengl api
    ...
  }

The last main() is programed by user obviously. Let's explain what the first two 
main() work for. 
As you know, the OpenGL is a lots of api to let programmer display the 3D object 
into 2D computer screen explained from book of concept of computer graphic.
3D graphic model can set light and object texture by user firstly, and calculating the 
postion of each vertex secondly, then color for each pixel automatically by 3D software 
and GPU thirdly, finally display the color of each pixel in computer screen.
But in order to let user/programmer add some special effect or decoration in 
coordinate for each vertex or in color for each pixel, OpenGL provides these two 
functions to do it. 
OpenGL uses fragment shader instead of pixel is : "Fragment shaders are a more 
accurate name for the same functionality as Pixel shaders. They arenâ€™t pixels 
yet, since the output still has to past several tests (depth, alpha, stencil) 
as well as the fact that one may be using antialiasing, which renders 
one-fragment-to-one-pixel non-true [#fragmentshader_reason]_.
Programmer is allowed to add their converting functions that compiler translate them 
into GPU instructions running on GPU processor. With these two shaders, new 
features have been added to allow for increased flexibility in the rendering 
pipeline at the vertex and fragment level [#shaderswiki]_.
Unlike the shaders example here [#shadersex]_, some converting functions 
for coordinate in vertex shader or for color in fragment shade are more 
complicated according the scenes of 
animation. Here is an example [#glsleffect]_.
In wiki shading page [#shading]_, Gourand and Phong shading methods make the
surface of object more smooth by glsl. Example glsl code of Gourand 
and Phong shading on OpenGL api are here [#smoothshadingex]_.
Since the hardware of graphic card and software graphic driver can be replaced, 
the compiler is run on-line meaning driver will compile the shaders program when 
it is run at first time and kept in cache after compilation [#on-line]_.

The shaders program is C-like syntax and can be compiled in few mini-seconds, 
add up this few mini-seconds of on-line compilation time in running OpenGL 
program is a good choice for dealing the cases of driver software or gpu 
hardware replacement [#onlinecompile]_. 

In addition, OpenGL provides vertex buffer object (VBO) allowing 
vertex array data to be stored in high-performance graphics memory on the 
server side and promotes efficient data transfer [#vbo]_ [#classorvbo]_.


OpenGL Shader compiler
-----------------------

OpenGL standard is here [#openglspec]_. The OpenGL is for desktop computer or server
while the OpenGL ES is for embedded system [#opengleswiki]_. Though shaders are only
a small part of the whole OpenGL software/hardware system. It is still a large effort 
to finish the compiler implementation since there are lots of api need to be 
implemented.
For example, there are 80 related texture APIs [#textureapi]_.
This implementation can be done by generating llvm extended intrinsic functions 
from shader parser of frontend compiler as well as llvm backend converting those intrinsic 
to gpu instructions as follows,

.. code-block:: console

  #version 320 es
  uniform sampler2D x;
  out vec4 FragColor;
  
  void main()
  {
      FragColor = texture(x, uv_2d, bias);
  }
  
  ...
  !1 = !{!"sampler_2d"}
  !2 = !{i32 SAMPLER_2D} : SAMPLER_2D is integer value for sampler2D, for example: 0x0f02
  ; A named metadata.
  !x_meta = !{!1, !2}

  define void @main() #0 {
      ...
      %1 = @llvm.gpu0.texture(metadata !x_meta, %1, %2, %3); // %1: %sampler_2d, %2: %uv_2d, %3: %bias
      ...
  }
  
  ...
     // gpu machine code
      sample2d_inst $1, $2, $3 // $1: %x, $2: %uv_2d, $3: %bias
      
About llvm intrinsic extended function, please refer this book here [#intrinsiccpu0]_.

.. code-block:: c++

  gvec4 texture(gsampler2D sampler, vec2 P, [float bias]);


.. _sampling: 
.. figure:: ../Fig/gpu/sampling_diagram.png
  :align: center
  :scale: 60 %

  Relationships between the texturing concept [#textureobject]_.

The :numref:`sampling` as above.
The texture object is not bound directly into the shader (where the actual 
sampling takes place). Instead, it is bound to a 'texture unit' whose index 
is passed to the shader. So the shader reaches the texture object by going 
through the texture unit. There are usually multiple texture units available 
and the exact number depends on the capability of your graphic card [#textureobject]_. 
A texture unit, also called a texture mapping unit (TMU) or a texture processing 
unit (TPU), is a hardware component in a GPU that does sampling operation.
The argument sampler in texture function as above is sampler_2d index from
'teuxture unit' for texture object [#textureobject]_. 

'sampler uniform variable':

There is a group of special uniform variables for that, according to the texture 
target: 'sampler1D', 'sampler2D', 'sampler3D', 'samplerCube', etc. 
You can create as many 'sampler uniform variables' as you want and assign the 
value of a texture unit to each one from the application. 
Whenever you call a sampling function on a 'sampler uniform variable' the 
corresponding texture unit (and texture object) will be used [#textureobject]_.


.. _sampling_binding: 
.. figure:: ../Fig/gpu/sampling_diagram_binding.png
  :align: center

  Binding sampler variables [#tpu]_.

As :numref:`sampling_binding`, the Java api
gl.bindTexture binding 'Texture Object' to 'Texture Unit'. 
The gl.getUniformLocation and gl.uniform1i associate 'Texture Unit' to
'sampler uniform variables'. 

gl.uniform1i(xLoc, 1): where 1 is 
'Texture Unit 1', 2 is 'Texture Unit 2', ..., etc [#tpu]_.

The following figure depicts how driver read metadata from compiled glsl obj,
OpenGL api associate 'Sample Variable' and gpu executing texture instruction.

.. _driverSamplerTable: 
.. figure:: ../Fig/gpu/driverSamplerTable.png
  :align: center

  Associating Sampler Variables and gpu executing texture instruction

Explaining the detail steps for figure above as the following.

1. In order to let the 'texture unit' binding by driver, frontend compiler must
pass the metadata of 'sampler uniform variable' (sampler_2d_var in this example) 
[#samplervar]_ to backend, and backend must 
allocate the metadata of 'sampler uniform variable' in the compiled 
binary file [#metadata]_. 

2. After gpu driver executing glsl on-line compiling,
driver read this metadata from compiled binary file and maintain a 
table of {name, SamplerType} for each 'sampler uniform variable'.

3. Api,

.. code-block:: c++

  xLoc = gl.getUniformLocation(prog, "x"); // prog: glsl program, xLoc
  
will get the location from the table for 'sampler uniform variable' x that
driver created and set the memory address xSlot to xLoc. 

SAMPLER_2D: is integer value for Sampler2D type.


4. Api,

.. code-block:: c++

  gl.uniform1i( xLoc, 1 );
  
will binding xLoc of 'sampler uniform variable' x to 
'Texture Unit 1' by writing 1 to the glsl binary metadata location of
'sampler uniform variable' x as follows,

.. code-block:: console

  {xLoc, 1} : 1 is 'Texture Unit 1', xLoc is the location(memory address) of 'sampler uniform variable' x
  
This api will set the descriptor register of gpu with this {xLoc, 1} 
information [#descriptorreg]_.
  
5. When executing the texture instructions from glsl binary file on gpu,

.. code-block:: console

  // gpu machine code
  load $1, &xSlot;
  sample2d_inst $1, $2, $3 // $1: %x, $2: %uv_2d, $3: %bias
      
the corresponding 'Texture Unit 1' on gpu will being executed through descriptor 
register of gpu {xLoc, 1} in this example since memory address xSlot includes the
value of xLoc. 

For instance, Nvidia texture instruction as follow,

.. code-block:: console

  tex.3d.v4.s32.s32  {r1,r2,r3,r4}, [tex_a, {f1,f2,f3,f4}];

Where tex_a is the texture memory address for 'sampler uniform variable' x,
and the pixel of coordinates (x,y,z) is given by (f1,f2,f3) user input.
The f4 is skipped for 3D texture.

Above tex.3d texture instruction load the calculated color of pixel (x,y.z) from 
texture image into GPRs (r1,r2,r3,r4)=(R,G,B,A). 
And fragment shader can re-calculate the color of this pixel with the color of
this pixel at texture image [#ptxtex]_. 

If it is 1d texture instruction, the tex.1d as follows,

.. code-block:: console

  tex.1d.v4.s32.f32  {r1,r2,r3,r4}, [tex_a, {f1}];

Since 'Texture Unit' is limited hardware accelerator on gpu, OpenGL
providing api to user program for binding 'Texture Unit' to 'Sampler Variables'.
As a result, user program is allowed doing load balance in using 'Texture Unit'
through OpenGL api without recompiling glsl. 
Fast texture sampling is one of the key requirements for good GPU performance 
[#tpu]_.

In addition to api for binding texture, OpenGL provides glTexParameteri api to
do Texture Wrapping [#texturewrapper]_. 
Furthmore the texture instruction for some gpu may including S# T# values in operands.
Same with associating 'Sampler Variables' to 'Texture Unit', S# and T# are
location of memory associated to Texture Wrapping descriptor registers allowing 
user program to change Wrapping option without re-compiling glsl.

Even glsl frontend compiler always expanding function call into inline function 
as well as llvm intrinsic extended function providing an easy way to do code 
generation through llvm td (Target Description) file written, 
GPU backend compiler is still a little complex than CPU backend. 
(But when considering the effort in frontend compier such as clang, or other 
toolchain such
as linker and gdb/lldb, of course, CPU compiler is not easier than
GPU compiler.)

Here is the software stack of 3D graphic system for OpenGL in linux [#mesawiki]_.
And mesa open source website is here [#mesa]_.

Architecture
------------

The leading GPU architecture of Nvidia's gpu is as the following 
figures.

.. _grid:

  core(grid) in Nvidia's gpu (figure from book [#Quantitative-gpu-mem]_)


- Grid is Vectorizable Loop [#Quantitative-gpu-griddef]_.

- Each multithreaded SIMD Processor is assigned 512 elements of the vectors to work on.
  As :numref:`grid`: The hardware Thread Block Scheduler assigns Thread Blocks to 
  multithreaded SIMD Processors. Thread Block <-> SIMD Processor. In this 8192 elements
  of matrix multiplication A[] = B[] * C[] example, Warp is the 512 elements of 
  matrix mutiplication.
  If another 512 elements of matrix addition F[] = D[] + E[] assigned in the same 
  Thread Block, then another Warp for it. Warp has it's own
  PC and TLR (Thread Level Registers). Warp may map to
  one whole function or part of function. Assume these two matrix mutiplication and 
  addition instructions come from the same function. Compiler and run time may assign
  them to the same Warp or different Warps [#Quantitative-gpu-warp]_.

- SIMD Processors are full processors with separate PCs and are programmed using
  threads [#Quantitative-gpu-threadblock]_. 
  As :numref:`simd-processors`, it assigns 16 Thread blocks to 16 SIMD Processors.
  
- As :numref:`grid`, 
  the maximum number of SIMD Threads that can execute simultaneously per Thread Block 
  (SIMD Processor) is 32 for the later Fermi-generation GPUs.
  Each SIMD Thread has 32 elements run as :numref:`threadslanes` on 
  16 SIMD lanes (number of functional units just same
  as in vector processor). So it takes 2 clock cycles to complete [#lanes]_.

- As the following code.
  Thread Block 0 has 16 threads and each thread (warp) has it's own PC. The The 
  SIMD Thread Scheduler select threads to run as :numref:`simd-processors`.

.. code-block:: c++

  Thread Block 0:
    A[i0] = B[i0] * C[i0]; // thread 0, i0:(0..31) run in one or few SIMD instructions
    A[i1] = B[i1] * C[i1]; // thread 1, i1:(32..63) 
    ...
    A[i15] = B[i15] * C[i15]; thread 15, i15:(480..511)

  Thread Block 1:
    A[i0] = B[i0] * C[i0]; // thread 0, i0:(512..543)
    ...

- Each thread handle 32 elements computing, so there are few hundred Thread 
  Level Registers in a thread to support the SIMT computing.



General purpose GPU
--------------------

Since GLSL shaders provide a general way for writing C code in them, if applying
a software frame work instead of OpenGL api, then the system can run some data
parallel computation on GPU for speeding up and even get CPU and GPU executing 
simultaneously. Furthmore, any language that allows the code running on the CPU to poll 
a GPU shader for return values, can create a GPGPU framework [#gpgpuwiki]_.
The following is a CUDA example to run large data in array on GPU [#cudaex]_ 
as follows,

.. code-block:: c++

  __global__
  void saxpy(int n, float a, float * x, float * y)
  {
    int i = blockIdx.x*blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < n) y[i] = a*x[i] + y[i];
  }
  
  int main(void)
  {
    ...
    cudaMemcpy(d_x, x, N*sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
    cudaMemcpy(d_y, y, N*sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
    ...
    cudaMemcpy(y, d_y, N*sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);
    ...
  }

In the programming example saxpy() above,

- blockIdx is index of ThreadBlock

- threadIdx is index of SIMD Thread

- blockDim is the number of total Thread Blocks in a Grid


The main() run on CPU while the saxpy() run on GPU. Through 
cudaMemcpyHostToDevice and cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost, CPU can pass data in x and in y 
array to GPU and get result from GPU to y array. 
Since both of these memory transfers trigger the DMA functions without CPU operation,
it mays speed up by running both CPU/GPU with their data in their own cache 
repectively.
After DMA memcpy from cpu's memory to gpu's, gpu operate the whole loop of matrix 
operation for "y[] = a*x[]+y[];"
instructions with one Grid. Furthermore liking vector processor, gpu provides
Vector Mask Registers to Handling IF Statements in Vector Loops as the following 
code [#VMR]_,

.. code:: c

  for(i=0;i<64; i=i+1)
    if (X[i] != 0)
      X[i] = X[i] â€“ Y[i];


.. code:: asm

  LV V1,Rx         ;load vector X into V1
  LV V2,Ry         ;load vector Y
  L.D F0,#0        ;load FP zero into F0
  SNEVS.D V1,F0    ;sets VM(i) to 1 if V1(i)!=F0
  SUBVV.D V1,V1,V2 ;subtract under vector mask 
  SV V1,Rx         ;store the result in X


GPU has smaller L1 cache than cpu for each core.
DMA memcpy map the data in cpu memory to each l1 cache of core on gpu memory.
Many gpu provides operations scatter and gather to access DRAM data for stream 
processing [#Quantitative-gpu-sparse-matrix]_ [#gpgpuwiki]_ [#shadingl1]_.

When the GPU function is dense computation in array such as MPEG4 encoder or
deep learning for tuning weights, it mays get much speed up [#mpeg4speedup]_. 
However when GPU function is matrix addition and CPU will idle for waiting 
GPU's result. It mays slow down than doing matrix addition by CPU only.
Arithmetic intensity is defined as the number of operations performed per word of 
memory transferred. It is important for GPGPU applications to have high arithmetic 
intensity else the memory access latency will limit computational speedup 
[#gpgpuwiki]_. 

Wiki here [#gpuspeedup]_ includes speedup applications for gpu as follows:

General Purpose Computing on GPU, has found its way into fields as diverse as 
machine learning, oil exploration, scientific image processing, linear algebra,
statistics, 3D reconstruction and even stock options pricing determination.
In addition, section "GPU accelerated video decoding and encoding" for video 
compressing [#gpuspeedup]_ gives the more applications for GPU acceleration.


Vulkan and spir-v
-----------------

Though OpenGL api existed in higher level with many advantages from sections
above, sometimes it cannot compete in efficience with direct3D providing 
lower levels api for operating memory by user program [#vulkanapiwiki]_. 
Vulkan api is lower level's C/C++ api to fill the gap allowing user program to 
do these things in OpenGL to compete against Microsoft direct3D. 
Here is an example [#vulkanex]_. Meanwhile glsl is C-like language. The vulkan 
infrastructure provides tool to compile glsl into an Intermediate Representation 
Form (IR) called spir-v [#spirvtoolchain]_ off-line. 
As a result, it saves part of compilation time from glsl to gpu instructions 
on-line
since spir-v is an IR of level closing to llvm IR [#spirvwiki]_. 
In addition, vulkan api reduces gpu drivers efforts in optimization and code 
generation [#vulkanapiwiki]_. These standards provide user programmer option to 
using vulkan/spir-v instead of OpenGL/glsl, and allow them pre-compiling glsl 
into spir-v off-line to saving part of on-line compilation time.

With vulkan and spir-v standard, the gpu can be used in OpenCL for Parallel 
Programming of Heterogeneous Systems [#opencl]_ [#computekernelwiki]_.
Similar with Cuda, a OpenCL example for fast Fourier transform (FFT) is here 
[#openclexfft]_.
Once OpenCL grows into a popular standard when more computer languages or 
framework supporting OpenCL language, GPU will take more jobs from CPU 
[#opencl-wiki-supported-lang]_.

Now, you find llvm IR expanding from cpu to gpu becoming influentially more and
more. And actually, llvm IR expanding from version 3.1 util now as I can feel.

.. [#Quantitative-threads-lanes] The SIMD Thread Scheduler includes a scoreboard that lets it know which threads of SIMD instructions are ready to run, and then it sends them off to a dispatch unit to be run on the multithreaded SIMD Processor. It is identical to a hardware thread scheduler in a traditional multithreaded processor (see Chapter 3), just that it is scheduling threads of SIMD instructions. Thus, GPU hardware has two levels of hardware schedulers: (1) the Thread Block Scheduler that assigns Thread Blocks (bodies of vectorized loops) to multi- threaded SIMD Processors, which ensures that thread blocks are assigned to the processors whose local memories have the corresponding data, and (2) the SIMD Thread Scheduler within a SIMD Processor, which schedules when threads of SIMD instructions should run.
