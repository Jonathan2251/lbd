Motivation
-----------

We all learned computer knowledge from school through the concept of book.
The concept is an effective way to know the big view. 
But once getting into develop a real complicated system, we often feel the 
concept from school or book is not much or not details enough. 
Compiler is a very complicated system, so traditionally 
the students in school learn this knowledge in concept and do the home work via 
yacc/lex tools to translate part of C or other high level language into 
immediate representation (IR) or assembly to feel the parsing knowledge and 
tools application. 

On the other hand, the compiler engineers who graduated from school often facing 
the real market complicated CPUs and specification. Since for market reason, 
there are a serial of CPUs and ABI (Application Binary Interface) to deal with. 
Moreover, for speed performance reason, the real compiler backend program is too 
complicated to be a learning material in compiler backend designing even the 
market CPU include only one CPU and ABI. 

This book develop the compiler backend along with a simple school designed CPU 
which called Cpu0. It include the implementation of a compiler backend, linker, 
llvm-objdump, elf2hex as well as Verilog language source code of Cpu0 
instruction set. 
We provide readers full source code to compile C/C++ program and see 
how the programs run on the Cpu0 machine created by verilog language.
Through this school learning purpose CPU, you get the chance to know the whole 
thing in compiler backend, linker, system tools and CPU design. Usually it is 
not easy from working in real CPU and compiler since the real job is too 
complicated to be finished by one single person only.

As my observation, LLVM advocated by some software engineers against gcc with 
two reasons. 
One is political with BSD license [#llvm-license]_ [#richard]_. 
The other is technical with following the 3 tiers of compiler software 
structure along with C++ object oriented technology.
GCC started with C and adopted C++ after near 20 years later [#wiki-gcc]_.
Maybe gcc adopted C++ just because llvm do that.
I learned C++ object oriented programming during studing in school.
After "Design Pattern", "C++/STL" and "object oriented design" books study,
I understand the C is easy to trace while C++ is easy to creating reusable
software units known as object.
If a programmer has well knowledge in "Design Pattern", then the C++ can
supply more reuse ability and rewrite ability. A book of "system language" 
about software quality that I have ever read , listing these items: read 
ability, rewrite ability, reuse ability and performance to define the software 
quality.
Object oriented programming exists for solving the big and complex
software development. 
Of course, compiler and OS are complex software without question, why do gcc 
and linux not using c++ [#wiki-cpp]_?
This is the reason I try to create a backend under llvm rather than gcc.

Preface
-------

The LLVM Compiler Infrastructure provides a versatile structure for creating new
backends. Creating a new backend should not be too difficult once you 
familiarize yourself with this structure. However, the available backend 
documentation is fairly high level and leaves out many details. This tutorial 
will provide step-by-step instructions to write a new backend for a new target 
architecture from scratch. 

We will use the Cpu0 architecture as an example to build our new backend. Cpu0 
is a simple RISC architecture that has been designed for educational purposes. 
More information about Cpu0, including its instruction set, is available 
`here <http://ccckmit.wikidot.com/ocs:cpu0>`_. The Cpu0 example code referenced in
this book can be found `here <http://jonathan2251.github.io/lbd/lbdex.tar.gz>`_.
As you progress from one chapter to the next, you will incrementally build the 
backend's functionality.

Since Cpu0 is a simple RISC CPU for educational purpose, it makes this llvm 
backend code simple too and easy to learning. In addition, Cpu0 supply the 
Verilog source code that you can run on your PC or FPGA platform when you go to 
chapter "Verify backend on Verilog simulator". To explain the backend design, 
we carefully design C/C++ program for each chapter new added function. Through 
these example code, readers can understand what IRs (llvm immediate form) the 
backend transfer from and the C/C++ code corresponding to these IRs.

This tutorial started using the LLVM 3.1 Mips backend as a reference and sync
to llvm 3.5 Mips at version 3.5.3. As our experience, reference and sync with
a released backend code will help upgrading your backend features and fixing 
bugs.
You can take advantage by compare difference from version to version, and hire
llvm development team effort. 
Since Cpu0 is an educational architecture, and it has missed some key pieces of 
documentation needed when developing a compiler, such as an Application Binary 
Interface (ABI). We implement our backend by borrowing information from the Mips 
ABI as a guide. You may want to familiarize yourself with the relevant parts of 
the Mips ABI as you progress through this tutorial.

This document can be a tutorial of toolchain development for a new CPU 
architecture. Many programmer gradutated from school with the knowledges of 
Compiler as well as Computer architecture but is not an professional engineer 
in compiler or CPU design. This document is a material to introduce these 
engineers how to programming a toolchain as well as designing a CPU based on 
the LLVM infrastructure without pay any money to buy software or hardware. 
Computer is the only device needed.

Finally, this book is not a compiler book in concept. It is for those readers 
who are interested in extending compiler toolchain to support a new CPU based on 
llvm structure. To program on Linux OS, you program a driver without knowing 
every details in OS. 
For example in a specific USB device driver program on Linux plateform, he 
or she will try to understand the USB specification, linux USB subsystem and 
common device driver working model and API. 
In the same way, to extend functions from a large software like this llvm 
umbrella project, you should find a way to reach the goal and ignore the 
details not on your way. 
Try to understand in details of every line of source code is not realistic if 
your project is an extended function from a well defined software structure. 
It only makes sense in rewriting the whole software structure.
Of course, if there are more llvm backend book or documents, then 
readers have the chance to know more about llvm by reading book or documents. 


Prerequisites
-------------

Readers should be comfortable with the C++ language and Object-Oriented 
Programming concepts. LLVM has been developed and implemented in C++, and it is 
written in a modular way so that various classes can be adapted and reused as 
often as possible.

Already having conceptual knowledge of how compilers work is a plus, and if you 
already have implemented compilers in the past you will likely have no trouble 
following this tutorial. As this tutorial will build up an LLVM backend 
step-by-step, we will introduce important concepts as necessary.

This tutorial references the following materials.  We highly recommend you read 
these documents to get a deeper understanding of what the tutorial is teaching:

`The Architecture of Open Source Applications Chapter on LLVM <http://www.aosabook.org/en/llvm.html>`_

`LLVM's Target-Independent Code Generation documentation <http://llvm.org/docs/CodeGenerator.html>`_

`LLVM's TableGen Fundamentals documentation <http://llvm.org/docs/TableGenFundamentals.html>`_

`LLVM's Writing an LLVM Compiler Backend documentation <http://llvm.org/docs/WritingAnLLVMBackend.html>`_

`Description of the Tricore LLVM Backend <https://opus4.kobv.de/opus4-fau/files/1108/tricore_llvm.pdf>`_

`Mips ABI document <http://www.linux-mips.org/pub/linux/mips/doc/ABI/mipsabi.pdf>`_

  Code generation and execution flow

The top part of :numref:`about-f1` is the work flow and software package 
of a computer program be generated and executed. IR stands for Intermediate 
Representation. 
The middle part is this book's work flow. Except clang, the other blocks need to 
be extended for a new backend development (Many backend extending clang too, but
Cpu0 backend has not this need at this point). 
This book implement the yellow boxes part. The green parts of this figure, lld 
and elf2hex for Cpu0 backend, can be found on 
http://jonathan2251.github.io/lbt/index.html.
The hex is the ascii file format 
using '0' to '9' and 'a' to 'f' for hexadecimal value representation since 
the Verilog language machine uses it as input file.

This book include 10,000 lines of source code for

1. Step-by-step, creating an llvm backend for the Cpu0. Chapter 2 to 
   11.
2. Cpu0 verilog source code. Chapter 12.

With these code, reader can generate Cpu0 machine code through Cpu0 llvm 
backend compiler, then see how it runs on your computer if the code without
global variable or relocation record for handling by linker. 
The pdf and epub are also available in the web. 
This is a tutorial for llvm backend developer but not for an expert. 
It also can be a material for those who have compiler and computer 
architecture book's knowledges and like to know how to extend the llvm 
toolchain to support a new CPU.

:ref:`sec-llvmstructure`:

This chapter introduces the Cpu0 architecture, a high-level view of LLVM, and 
how Cpu0 will be targeted in in an LLVM backend. 
This chapter will run you through the initial steps of building the backend, 
including initial work on the target description (td), setting up cmake and 
LLVMBuild files, and target registration. Around 750 lines of source 
code are added by the end of this chapter.

:ref:`sec-backendstructure`:

This chapter highlights the structure of an LLVM backend using by UML graphs, 
and we continue to build the Cpu0 backend. 
Thousands of lines of source code are added, most of which are common from one 
LLVM backends to another, regardless of the target architecture. 
By the end of this chapter, the Cpu0 LLVM backend will support less than ten 
instructions to generate some initial assembly output. 

:ref:`sec-addingmoresupport`:

Over ten C operators and their corresponding LLVM IR instructions are introduced 
in this chapter. 
Few houndred lines of source code, mostly in .td Target Description files, are 
added. With these houndred lines of source code, the backend can now translate 
the **+, -, \*, /, &, |, ^, <<, >>, !** and **%** C operators into the 
appropriate Cpu0 assembly code. Usage of the ``llc`` debug option and of 
**Graphviz** as a debug tool are introduced in this chapter.

:ref:`sec-genobjfiles`:

Object file generation support for the Cpu0 backend is added in this chapter, 
as the Target Registration structure is introduced. 
Based on llvm structure, the Cpu0 backend can generate big and little endian 
ELF object files without much effort.

:ref:`sec-globalvars`:

Global variable handling is added in this chapter. Cpu0 supports PIC and static 
addressing mode, both addressing mode explained as their functionality are 
implemented.

:ref:`sec-othertypesupport`:

In addition to type int, other data type such as pointer, char, bool, long long, 
structure and array are added in this chapter.

:ref:`sec-controlflow`:

Support for flow control statements, such as, **if, else, while, for, goto, 
switch, case** as well as both a simple optimization software pass and hardware 
instructions for control statement optimization discussed in this chapter. 

:ref:`sec-funccall`:

This chapter details the implementation of function calls in the Cpu0 backend. 
The stack frame, handling incoming & outgoing arguments, and their corresponding 
standard LLVM functions are introduced. 

:ref:`sec-elf`:

This chapter details Cpu0 support for the well-known ELF object file format. 
The ELF format and binutils tools are not a part of LLVM, but are introduced. 
This chapter details how to use the ELF tools to verify and analyze the object 
files created by the Cpu0 backend. 
The disassemble command ``llvm-objdump -d`` support for Cpu0 is added in the 
last section of this chapter.

:ref:`sec-asm`:

Support the translation of hand code assembly language into obj under the llvm 
insfrastructure. 

:ref:`sec-c++`:

Support C++ language features. It's under working.  

:ref:`sec-verilog`:

Create the CPU0 virtual machine with Verilog language of Icarus tool first. 
With this tool, feeding the hex file which generated by llvm-objdump to the Cpu0 
virtual machine and seeing the Cpu0 running result on PC computer.

:ref:`sec-appendix-installing`:

Details how to set up the LLVM source code, development tools, and environment
setting for Mac OS X and Linux platforms.

:ref:`sec-appendix-doc`:

This book uses Sphinx to generate pdf and epub format of document further.
Details about how to install tools to and generate these docuemnts and 
regression test for Cpu0 backend are included.
